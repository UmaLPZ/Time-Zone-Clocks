# Time Zone Clocks
This plugin allows you to add clocks for different time zones to a sidebar on RuneLite. Hopefully this is helpful for anyone that has friends in different time zones or part of a clan with memebers from all around the world.

This plugin's code is heavily based off the code for the [Market Watcher](https://github.com/BobTabrizi/market-watcher) plugin. I am not very knowledgable with Java so please feel free to let me know of any mistakes I made and how I can improve the code.
